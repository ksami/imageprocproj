function rotation = findRotationMatrix(centre_face, centre_rotated)
% Given centres of facial features, find rotation matrix to
% transform centre_face into centre_rotated
% centre_face and centre_rotated are both structures containing
% eyeL, eyeR, nose, mouth
% each of the features are points with x y coords
% eg. centre_face.eyeL.x
